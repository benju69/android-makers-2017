Want to submit a talk to Android Makers France? Need some help to understand the various submission types? Here is the page for you.


You can submit four kind of proposals:<br />
 1. Keynote talk<br />
 2. Conference - 40mn talk<br />
 3. Lightning talk - 15mn<br />
 4. Workshop<br />


**Keynote**<br />
Keynote talks last 40 minutes and must be interesting for every attendees whatever their background. Be warned, those two talks are the first ones in the morning :)

**Conference - 40mn**<br />
Those 40 minutes talks are the ones we are doing during most of the PAUG meetups. If you’re planning to submit a talk like this you should keep some time for Q&A in addition to your talk. We recommend a 35mn talk and 5mn question time. If you want to do it differently it’s up to you, just keep it under 40 minutes.

**Lightning talk - 15mn**<br />
Lightning talks are meant to be quick and efficient. The 15mn allocated also includes the Q&A. Due to the short time of those sessions, we will probably accept only one or two questions (under one minute).

**Workshop**<br />
Workshops must be under 1h30. Workshop is the right place to transform theory into practise. You may take the first 30 minutes to give some basic informations and give the opportunity to everyone to have the right background required to follow up. We will accept not only developer workshop centered, but also design or agile one.

If you’re thinking about organizing a workshop in two parts, don’t hesitate to do two submissions. We simply believe it’s better for everyone to take a break after 1h30 of intense thinking.
